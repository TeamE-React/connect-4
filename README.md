Connect 4 is a turn-based game where two players take turns dropping colored balls from the top into a column. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The aim of each player is to be the first to form a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line of four of one's own balls.
  
The purpose of this project is mainly to implement the algorithm and test its performance in a simple game.
